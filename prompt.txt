When we run the server and the client, the effect is that the server goes in an infinite loop of 

Accepted connection (fd 5)

There are 3 main problems:

1. Why is the server re-using the same fd, rather than associating new ones to each client?
2. Why isn't the server sending messages to clients and allowing possibility of disconenct? Server is holding clients hostage.
3. Why isn't the server supporting multiple concurrent connections?

Recall that our goal is to have a multi-client benchmark for our client-server architecture using io_uring. Please describe the changes we should make to fix these problems.
