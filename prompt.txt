Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/conor/git/uring_server/main.py", line 150, in <module>
    asyncio.create_task(run_server_and_client())
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/asyncio/tasks.py", line 336, in create_task

RuntimeError: no running event loop
sys:1: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'run_server_and_client' was never awaited


How can we fix this? We want main.py to --
1. build the server and client (working already)
2. run the server and client with asyncio, and wait until client process completes (not working)
3. if extra arg is given, stream response from gpt4 with prompt including state.txt and prompt.txt (working already)
